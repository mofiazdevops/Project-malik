              everyone! Thanks to everyone that you guys joined. So, I‚Äôm
              assuming that most of you know us, ‚ÄúIdeaology‚Äù and, of course, the
              IDEA token. Let me introduce it to those who don‚Äôt know who we
              are, what we do, and what IDEA is. Ideaology is a platform that
              promotes blockchain by developing blockchain-based applications.
              IDEA is a token for this platform that uses in different
              applications and for crypto investment, of course!
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              Okay, I think that‚Äôs enough introduction. Let‚Äôs move forward to
              our Question & Answers session, for which we all are here. I‚Äôm
              excited to share our roadmap with you and show you what we‚Äôve done
              and what we‚Äôre doing!

              There are a lot of exciting projects we are working on. The major
              highlight of this year until now is WorkAsPro.
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              First of all, thanks to you guys who support us. It‚Äôs all become
              possible because of you. We understand that crypto will be the
              future of currency, so we thought, why not develop a freelancing
              platform that pays in crypto? So, we developed a freelancing
              platform (WorkAsPro) on blockchain technology. Freelancers can
              earn in IDEA tokens and get 100% payment without any platform fee.
              Some other cryptocurrency options are also available.
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              Besides this, we developed the games ‚ÄúReal 8 Ball Poll,‚Äù ‚ÄúSave the
              Pupp,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCar Racing Game.‚Äù These games are play-to-earn games
              where players can earn different prizes and IDEA tokens.
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              Now, we are working on NFT Marketplace development where users can
              sell their NFTs and earn. We are working on blockchain technology
              to develop cutting-edge solutions for you!

              As you all know, cryptocurrency is booming right now. Most people
              want to get paid in crypto, and many businesses also pay them in
              crypto. Even though we‚Äôre paying our employees in crypto. So, back
              to your question, what makes WorkAsPro so special for us and other
              crypto lovers is its innovative platform. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want
              to use a secure and transparent freelancing platform that makes
              sure everything goes smoothly?
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              WorkAsPro is also the best platform to find talent, as it has
              strong AI that prevents any fraudulent activity. When the project
              starts, the payment from Buyer is transferred to Escrow and then
              released when Buyer accepts the project from Seller. It‚Äôs good
              news for both Seller and Buyer that their payment is safe.
            </p>
            <p className="blogs_content_p">
              Also, this platform charges the lowest platform fee, and, in the
              case of the IDEA tokens, it doesn‚Äôt even charge any fee. So, what
              else could be better? It‚Äôs the best platform in every aspect!

              I think people still can‚Äôt understand cryptocurrency properly.
              Sometimes, they become blindfolded when investing in some coin or
              token and then blame the platform for it. The crypto market is
              volatile. Every cryptocurrency sees ups and downs, so it doesn‚Äôt
              always mean that that particular coin or token will never rise
              again. Same with our case, unfortunately, our token is going
              through a bit of a downfall that is quite beneficial for a lot of
              investors who can invest at a low price and then generate revenue
              from it. But on the other hand, some get disappointed. But we can
              assure you IDEA is going to see good days soon.

              Well, I would suggest going through the history of the token in
              which you are going to invest. See if the platform is developing
              new solutions that can promote that particular token, and yeah,
              the same is the case with IDEA tokens.

              Okay, so I know this is the question roaming around in a lot of
              minds because of the current dip in IDEA tokens. But as you all
              know, the crypto market was unstable in past times, which caused a
              lot of dips even for the top cryptocurrencies. Well, back to your
              question, Ideaology is working on a lot of developments and
              innovations. It will increase the use cases of IDEA tokens which
              will eventually increase their value. And trust me, that time is
              close!

              The crypto market is growing fast. It‚Äôs hard to predict the future
              as we all have seen rapid ups and downs. However, I believe that

              IDEA token has several use cases within different applications.
              IDEA tokens are used in WorkAsPro as a means of payment for
              freelancers. It is being used in play-to-earn games as a reward
              for players who achieve certain milestones. NFT Marketplace and
              Manialands also use IDEA tokens to purchase and trade NFTS and
              other game assets.
